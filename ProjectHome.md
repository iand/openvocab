OpenVocab is a project created by [Ian Davis](http://iandavis.com/) that enables anyone to participate in the creation of a open and shared RDF vocabulary.
The project uses wiki principles to allow properties and classes to be created in the vocabulary.

The code is written in PHP and the data is hosted on the [Talis Platform](http://n2.talis.com/). The project uses [Moriarty](http://code.google.com/p/moriarty/) to interface with the Platform and [Konstrukt](http://code.google.com/p/konstrukt/) to simplify the web programming.
